# AirQuality-Canada
This repository contains source code for a small data exploration project on fine particulate matter levels in Canada from 2000-2014.

## Dataset
The data for this project can be found at http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/8fa6c70b-49bc-4101-b935-09fd9a940ae3 .

## Skills
This analysis relies heavily on the R packages plotly and ggplot2 and uses linear regressions and Tukey's Post-Hoc tests.

## Complete Analysis
Complete analysis for this project can be found on my personal website: http://cbobbie.wixsite.com/colleenbobbie/air-quality-in-canada

## Summary
  * There were substantial differences in average concentrations between regions during the sampling period, as Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario had significantly higher concentrations of fine particulate matter than the other regions sampled. 
  * Southern Ontario saw a significant decrease in overall fine particulate matter concentrations, and the Prairies and Northern Ontario saw a near-significant increase in concentrations, but overall the national average remained unchanged.
  * *Importantly, all regions fell below the 2015 annual standard.*
